---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate
availability of **Calamares 3.2.0**, a features-and-functionality release
following the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.
