Squid are known to hibernate, and the Calamares team is no
different. In the winter (northern hemisphere) of 2020,
we will be taking some time off. Pull requests are still welcome,
and you can continue to file issues, but do not expect rapid
response until the second week of January. Various community
members may be more active, and we hope to see everyone
alive-and-hacking in the new year (expect a 3.2.36 mid-January).
