title: "Calamares 3.2.35.1 released"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This is a hotfix translation release in the 3.2 series.
Some strange string artifacts appeared, leading to `{1?}` being
displayed in various user-facing messages. These have been removed
and the translations updated.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.
