The Calamares team is happy to announce a re-vamp of the
Calamares website. Thanks to Anke Boersma (better known
as the driving force behind [KaOS](https://kaosx.us/)) the design, layout and
technology behind the website have jumped forward.

While the overall information provided by the Calamares website
is unchanged -- most of the "real" information lives in the
[Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki)
or in the documentation in the [source code](https://github.com/calamares/calamares#calamares-distribution-independent-installer-framework) there
are new screenshots, new navigation, new links to downloads
and the [Calamares-extensions](https://github.com/calamares/calamares-extensions)
is now presented as a first-class citizen.

Thanks Anke!

Pull requests to update the site should go to the *issue-1533* branch for now,
since that is the one now deployed online.
