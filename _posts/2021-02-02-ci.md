title: "Calamares CI Migration"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

Calamares has made grateful use of the [Travis-CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
system for many years. The combination of quick builds, easily configured,
and good IRC notifications have been useful to the team and the Open Source
ecosystem. However, Travis-CI is reducing the amount of service it
provides (for free!) to Open Source projects, so Calamares is moving
its CI elsewhere.

CI setup is non-trivial, and moving CI to another platform
takes time away from regular development. One medium-term
upside, though, is that we no longer need to be polite
about resource usage: Calamares is moving CI to GitHub actions,
and we'll grind through way more VMs as a matter of course.

All the CI actions for Calamares can be found
[here on GitHub](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/actions),
although the day-to-day builds in response to pushes
are in the [ci-neon](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/actions?query=workflow%3Aci-neon)
action, which builds Calamares on a recent KDE neon. There are
other builds that happen on a schedule with other base systems.
