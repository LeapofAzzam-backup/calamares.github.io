Calamares in its current state can already install a Linux operating system (KaOS, Manjaro and Maui are confirmed to work).

Are you looking for a system installer from your Linux distribution? Grab Calamares, mix and match any number of Calamares modules (or write your own in Python or C++), throw together some branding, package it up and you are ready to ship!

Look for us in #calamares on chat.freenode.net.
