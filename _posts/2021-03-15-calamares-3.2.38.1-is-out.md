excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This is a hotfix release, although what is being fixed is
that something mentioned in the changelog was not included in
the released tarball. So we get a new release,
**with** all the bits promised for 3.2.38 and some
translation updates and minor bugfixes to boot.

<!--more-->

This hotfix release is for this item in the release notes of 3.2.38:
 - The .desktop file for Calamares now makes a longer trip, calling
   `sh -c "pkexec calamares"`; distributions may still need to adjust.
The change had been lost while updating other files. It has been restored
in `calamares.desktop` and `calamares.desktop.in`. (Reported by Erik)
