A minor bugfix tweak release. Since this contains yet **another**
autologin-related fix, and there is nothing large enough to justify
a 3.2.40 release yet, add it to the growing tail of 3.2.39. (Reported
by Joe Kamprad, #1672). Also fixes a regression from 3.2.28 in
localized packages (e.g. *package-LOCALE* did not work).
