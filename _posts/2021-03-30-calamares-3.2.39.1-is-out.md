This is a hotfix release for an annoying, but low-impact problem:
a mismatch between the *users* module and the *displaymanager* module
prevents autologin from being configured. The list of (partly)
supported desktop environments for *displaymanager* has been expanded as well.
Improvements supplied by, and bug reports from, Erik Dubois. Thank you!
