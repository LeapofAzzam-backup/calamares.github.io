All done. Calamares will provide a final summary and allow you to re-start your machine into your newly installed Linux operating system or go back to live mode.

A full log of the install is available as installation.log in the home directory of the Live user and this log is copied to /var/log/installation.log of the target system.

Hopefully this Guide has answered any questions you had about using this Installer. If anything is not clear enough then it would be really appreciated if you can get in touch to get the needed changes in.
